**Token Creation Project**

In this project,we are creating a contract using Solidity and creating several public variables and mint function to increase the total supply and also to decrease the total supply.

**Description**

For this project,we are creating two functions:-

1) The first function, we will increase the total supply by the value that we are passing and also increasing the balances by the same value.

2) In second function, we are doing just the opposite of what we have done in the first function,we are decreasing the supply by the value passed by the user.
